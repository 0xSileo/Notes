- Lack of trust 1: builders can’t trust the proposer with their payload. If they simply give their payload, the proposer can simply steal the information (MEV) included in it. Validators have gone to extreme cases in order to steal this information [3](https://ethresear.ch/t/equivocation-attacks-in-mev-boost-and-epbs/15338)


## Useful resources

- [Beaver builder](https://beaverbuild.org/). [According to 0xDoug](https://twitter.com/0xdoug/status/1793753550834847839), "Beaver’s comparative advantage is CEX-DEX arbitrage. The more majors are moving on a second by second basis at Binance, the stronger beaver’s bidding power gets compared to other builders".
